# Project-B-RC-Plane-
Our project is driven by a deep-seated curiosity to unravel the complexities of aerodynamics and understand the fundamental principles governing flight. Motivated by a desire to grasp the mechanics behind how airplanes take to the skies, we embarked on the ambitious endeavor of constructing a simple RC plane using accessible materials.
